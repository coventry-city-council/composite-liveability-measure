# Composite Liveability Measure

# What is the composite liveability measure approach?

The composite liveability measure is an approach to systematically evaluate the relative merits of different places. We have used the approach to create the comprehensive composite liveability measure. The approach can be used to compare and contrast any set of places to another using a set of metrics.

# Why did we create a composite liveability measure?

When we started this work in the 2012, an index to rank the relative merits of local authority areas did not exist, so we sought to create our own combining the best of existing measures.

# Comprehensive Composite Liveability Measure

The comprehensive composite liveability measure is designed to compare and contrast the prosperity, liveability and sustainability of places. It illustrates why one place may score more or less than another using ten categories. It can assess the relative merits of one location over another at a single point in time and change over time using the following ‘ideal type’ or criteria:

An ideal place to live is one where basic needs for housing, employment, education, security and health are met in ways which are environmentally sustainable, which do not exacerbate inequalities, which foster subjective wellbeing, where essential services are readily accessible and where the citizenry are fully engaged in the life and governance of their place.

The ‘ideal type’ is transformed into ten categories – five of which were related to basic needs (thematic domains) and five related to the way these needs might be met (cross-cutting domains). Metrics were picked with specialists working in each field, on the basis that they were available at the local authority level; up-to-date; and clearly directional. Metrics have changed over time to ensure they continue to best represent each category.
