# Composite Liveability Measure

# What is the composite liveability measure approach?

The composite liveability measure (CLM) is an approach to systematically evaluate the relative merits of different places.
The CLM approach has been used to create the comprehensive composite liveability measure (CCLM).
The CLM approach can be used to compare and contrast any set of places to another using any indicator.

# Why did we create a composite liveability measure?

Coventry has set out its ambition to become a ‘Top Ten City’: a city the size and stature of Coventry should have aspirations to match.

However, a standard measure or ranking of cities does not exist. There are many measures out there to compare and contrast places – combining economic growth with liveability. So we decided to create our own, combining the best of measures out there.

# Comprehensive Composite Liveability Measure

The comprehensive composite liveability measure is designed to compare and contrast the prosperity, liveability and sustainability of places. The CCLM illustrates why one place may score more or less than another using ten domains. It can assess the relative merits of one location over another at a single point in time and change over time using the following ‘ideal type’ or criteria:

An ideal place to live is one where basic needs for housing, employment, education, security and health are met in ways which are environmentally sustainable, which do not exacerbate inequalities, which foster subjective wellbeing, where essential services are readily accessible and where the citizenry are fully engaged in the life and governance of their place.

The ‘ideal type’ is transformed into ten domains – five of which were related to basic needs (thematic domains) and five related to the way these needs might be met (cross-cutting domains). Indicators were picked with specialists working in each field, on the basis that they were available at the local authority level; up-to-date; and clearly directional.
